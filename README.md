Dv.CO is a trendy donut store founded by David, a passionate baker with a knack for creating unique and flavorful donuts.
Situated in a bustling neighborhood, Dv.CO quickly became a local favorite, known for its wide variety of donuts, from classic
glazed to exotic flavors like matcha and salted caramel bacon.
To enhance customer experience and streamline operations, David decided to digitalize the store's services.
David reached out to you for assistance in creating an application. The application is designed to support
two main roles: Admin and User. Users can select their favorite donuts, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.
Admins, on the other hand, have the capability to manage the inventory by adding, updating, or deleting donut listings
 from the database, ensuring that the offerings are always fresh and enticing.
The project involves developing an application using JavaFX as the programming language and MySQL for the database.
